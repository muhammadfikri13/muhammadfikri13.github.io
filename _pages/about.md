Fresh Graduate of Computer Systems with a keen interest in the realms of `cloud computing`, `design`, and an avid enthusiasm for the latest advancements. Successfully accomplished the Capstone Project at [Bangkit Academy](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit) 2023, excelling as a Cloud Engineer.

I earned the prestigious Gold Prize in an international competition at [IPITEX](https://ipitex.nrct.go.th/) (Intellectual Property, Invention, Innovation and Technology Exposition), as well as a Gold Medal at the World Young Inventors Exhibition ([WYIE](https://itex.com.my/blog/wyie/)) in 2023.

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I find joy in engaging activities such as gaming and music. I even share my endeavors on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLgvHQQrFGwz5-eZrL222jw) channel for a touch of humor and entertainment!ðŸ˜‚
